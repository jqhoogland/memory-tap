# Memory Tap
Pet project to help keep track of your memory palaces on your phone.

The idea is that you can go on a walk and log suitable loci for a memory palace, then end up with a map of your memory palace journey.

I've stopped working on this because other things have gotten in the way. So I'm putting it online for anyone wanting to take inspiration.

TODO: Add some pictures, so you get people a little more excited.
